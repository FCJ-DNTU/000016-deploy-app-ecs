#### Infrastructure Configuration

To participate in this workshop, you need to complete the configuration steps outlined in the workshop [Deploy Application on Docker Container](https://fcj-dntu.github.io/000015-deploy-app-docker).

After finishing the workshop on deploying applications in Docker Containers, you will have the necessary infrastructure components to proceed with ECS, including:

- EC2 Instance
- RDS Database Instance
- Application deployed as a Container
- Image pushed to Docker Hub or Amazon ECR

With the services and infrastructure set up, we will move forward with the workshop on deployment in ECS.
