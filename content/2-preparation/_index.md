For increased security, we recommend that you configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) to help protect your AWS resources.

You can enable **one** MFA device (of any kind) per root user or IAM user. 

In this guide, we will go through 3 MFA options:
1. [Configure RDS](1-config-rds)
2. [Launch EC2](2-launch-ec2)
3. [Install Dependencies](3-install-dependencies)
4. [Create CodeDeploy Role](4-create-codedeploy-role)
