#### Prerequisites for the workshop

To participate in this workshop, you need to complete the configuration steps outlined in the workshop [Deploy Application on Docker Container](https://fcj-dntu.github.io/000015-deploy-app-docker).

After completing the workshop on deploying an application on Docker Container, you will have the necessary infrastructure ready to proceed with ECS, including:

- EC2 Instance
- RDS Database Instance
- Application deployed as a Container
- Image pushed to Docker Hub or Amazon ECR

With these services and infrastructure in place, we will proceed with the workshop on deploying applications using ECS.
