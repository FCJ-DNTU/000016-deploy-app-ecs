### Introduction to Deploying Applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

After completing the setup of Docker images, containers, and RDS in the previous steps, we will now move forward by deploying our application on **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** â€” a powerful AWS service that allows you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

Amazon ECS automates container management, including creating, maintaining, and scaling tasks and services, while seamlessly integrating with other AWS services such as **Amazon RDS** for databases, **Elastic Load Balancer** for load balancing, and **VPC** for networking. In this section, we will:

- **Create an ECS Cluster** to host your containers.
- **Define tasks** for the applications packaged as Docker images.
- **Deploy services** on ECS to ensure scalability and high availability.
- **Connect ECS to RDS** so the application can securely and efficiently access the database.

With ECS, you can leverage features like **Auto Scaling** to ensure your application is always ready to handle increased traffic without worrying about managing the infrastructure.

#### Process Description

Initially, I will reconfigure the infrastructure from task 15. Then proceed to configure additional resources such as **private subnet**, **NAT gateway**, and **security group**. Once the infrastructure is stable, the next step is to prepare for deployment, including the following steps (as seen in the task):

1. **Build image** and then push it to both **ECR** and **Dockerhub**.
2. Pre-register a namespace in **CloudMap**.
3. Create an **ECS Cluster**.
4. Create **task definitions** for both **Frontend** and **Backend** (starting with backend, then frontend), both of which include environment variables.
5. Create an **ALB**, including a **target group** for the **Frontend service**.
6. Create an **ECS Service**, starting with the **backend** first, then the **frontend**.
7. Verify the result.
